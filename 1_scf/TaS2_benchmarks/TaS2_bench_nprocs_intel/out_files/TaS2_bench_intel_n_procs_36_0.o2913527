     Parallel version (MPI), running on    36 processors

     MPI processes distributed on     3 nodes
     R & G space division:  proc/nbgrp/npool/nimage =      36
     35078 MiB available memory on the printing compute node when the environment starts
 
     Reading input from in_files/TaS2_bench_intel_n_procs_36_0.scf

     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10

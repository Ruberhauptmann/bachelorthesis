     Parallel version (MPI), running on    28 processors

     MPI processes distributed on     2 nodes
     R & G space division:  proc/nbgrp/npool/nimage =      28
     907 MiB available memory on the printing compute node when the environment starts
 
     Reading input from in_files/silicon_bench_nd_9_n_procs_28_4.scf

     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:

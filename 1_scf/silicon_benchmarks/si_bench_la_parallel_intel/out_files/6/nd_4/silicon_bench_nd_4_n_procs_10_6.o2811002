     Parallel version (MPI), running on    10 processors

     MPI processes distributed on     1 nodes
     R & G space division:  proc/nbgrp/npool/nimage =      10
     1220 MiB available memory on the printing compute node when the environment starts
 
     Reading input from in_files/silicon_bench_nd_4_n_procs_10_6.scf

     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10

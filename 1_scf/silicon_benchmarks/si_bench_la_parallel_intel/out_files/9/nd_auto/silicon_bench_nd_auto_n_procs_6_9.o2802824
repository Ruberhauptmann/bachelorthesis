     Parallel version (MPI), running on     6 processors

     MPI processes distributed on     1 nodes
     R & G space division:  proc/nbgrp/npool/nimage =       6
     5063 MiB available memory on the printing compute node when the environment starts
 
     Reading input from in_files/silicon_bench_nd_auto_n_procs_6_9.scf

     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:

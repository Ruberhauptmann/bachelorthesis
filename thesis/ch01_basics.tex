\section{The electronic structure problem\label{sec:theory_schrödinger}}

In solid state physics, one general problem we are concerned with is finding the properties of the ground state of an isolated system of \(N\) interacting electrons in an external potential.
The system is described by the Schrödinger equation
\begin{equation}
    \ope{H} \Psi (\vb{r}_1, \ldots, \vb{r}_N) = E \Psi (\vb{r}_1, \ldots, \vb{r}_N)
\end{equation}
with the Hamiltonian
\begin{align}
    \ope{H} &= \ope{T}_e + \ope{V}_{n-e} + \ope{V}_{e-e} + \ope{V}_{n-n} \\
    &= -\sum_i \frac{1}{2} \nabla^2_i - \sum_i \sum_{\alpha} \frac{Z_{\alpha}}{\vert \vb{r}_i - \vb{R}_{\alpha} \vert} + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i \neq j} \frac{1}{\vert \vb{r}_i - \vb{r}_j \vert} + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{\alpha \beta} \frac{Z_{\alpha} Z_{\beta}}{R_{\alpha \beta}}
\end{align}
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(\ope{T}_e\) is the kinetic energy of the electrons
    \item \(\ope{V}_{n-e}\) is the potential energy of the electrons in the field of the nuclei
    \item \(\ope{U}_{e-e}\) is the Coulomb interaction between the electrons and
    \item \(\ope{W}_{n-n}\) is the Coulomb interaction between the nuclei
\end{itemize}

The wavefunction \(\Psi (\vb{r}_1, \ldots, \vb{r}_N)\) 


\section{Density Functional Theory\label{sec:theory_dft}}

A direct solution to the electronic structure problem, this meaning obtaining the ground-state many-body wavefunction \(\Psi (\vb{r_1}, \ldots, \vb{r_N})\) for a given potential is analytically impossible even for a small number of electrons. 
As such, the need for good approximations to obtain results for real world
systems is high.
One particularly successful approach is \emph{Density Functional Theory} (DFT).

%Describing the approach of DFT comes in two parts: first, the exact reformulation of the electronic structure problem in terms of the electronic ground state
%density and second the approximation made by 

\subsection{Hohenberg-Kohn theorems}

The basis for DFT lies in the excact reformulation of the outlined electronic structure problem by Hohenberg and Kohn \cite{hohenberg_inhomogeneous_1964}.
This reformulation uses the ground state density of the electronic system as the basic variable.

Hohenberg-Kohn theorems:

\begin{enumerate}[I]
    \item The external potential (and by extension the ground state wave function and the ground state energy) are  unique functionals of the ground state density (except for an additive constant).
    \item The ground state energy minimizes the energy functional,
    \[E[n(r)] > E_0 \;\forall n(r) \neq n_0 (r)\].
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Kohn-Sham equations}

One way of approximating the functional \(F[n]\) was given by Kohn and Sham \cite{kohn_self-consistent_1965}. The idea is to use a non-interacting
auxiliary system of electrons and introduce a correction potential. 

\section{Parallel computing\label{sec:parallel_computing}}

The following section will give an overview of the technical aspects of running computer code (such as \QE) on massively parallel computing environments (such as the PHYSnet compute cluster).
The information presented can be found in any textbook on parallel/high-perfomance computing \cite{hager_introduction_2010}.

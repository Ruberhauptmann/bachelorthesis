(ii) To establish some of the mathematical underpinnings of “universal density functional” theory for the ground state energy as begun by Hohenberg and Kohn. We show that the HK functional is not defined for all ρ and we present several ways around this difficulty. Several less obvious problems remain, however. (iii) Since the functional mentioned above is not computable, we review examples of explicit functionals that have the virtue of yielding rigorous bounds to the energy.},

The Karlsruhe basis sets are very appealing because they constitute balanced and economical basis sets of graded quality from partially polarized double zeta to heavily polarized quadruple zeta for all elements up to radon (Z = 86). The extension consists of adding a minimal set of diffuse functions to a subset of the elements. This yields basis sets labeled minimally augmented or with ``ma'' as a prefix. We find that diffuse functions are not quite as important for the def2 basis sets as they are for Pople basis sets, but they are still necessary for good results on barrier heights and electron affinities. We provide assessments and validations of this extension for a variety of data sets and representative cases. We recommend the new ma-TZVP basis set for general-purpose applications of density functional theory.},

    abstract = {In this paper, the possibility is explored to speed up Hartree–Fock and hybrid density functional calculations by forming the Coulomb and exchange parts of the Fock matrix by different approximations. For the Coulomb part the previously introduced Split-RI-J variant (F. Neese, J. Comput. Chem. 24 (2003) 1740) of the well-known ‘density fitting’ approximation is used. The exchange part is formed by semi-numerical integration techniques that are closely related to Friesner’s pioneering pseudo-spectral approach. Our potentially linear scaling realization of this algorithm is called the ‘chain-of-spheres exchange’ (COSX). A combination of semi-numerical integration and density fitting is also proposed. Both Split-RI-J and COSX scale very well with the highest angular momentum in the basis sets. It is shown that for extended basis sets speed-ups of up to two orders of magnitude compared to traditional implementations can be obtained in this way. Total energies are reproduced with an average error of <0.3kcal/mol as determined from extended test calculations with various basis sets on a set of 26 molecules with 20–200 atoms and up to 2000 basis functions. Reaction energies agree to within 0.2kcal/mol (Hartree–Fock) or 0.05kcal/mol (hybrid DFT) with the canonical values. The COSX algorithm parallelizes with a speedup of 8.6 observed for 10 processes. Minimum energy geometries differ by less than 0.3pm in the bond distances and 0.5° in the bond angels from their canonical values. These developments enable highly efficient and accurate self-consistent field calculations including nonlocal Hartree–Fock exchange for large molecules. In combination with the RI-MP2 method and large basis sets, second-order many body perturbation energies can be obtained for medium sized molecules with unprecedented efficiency. The algorithms are implemented into the ORCA electronic structure system.}

We start with an overview of the main experimental aspects of oxygen K-edge X-ray absorption measurements including X-ray sources, monochromators, and detection schemes. Many recent oxygen K-edge studies combine X-ray absorption with time and spatially resolved measurements and/or operando conditions. The main theoretical and conceptual approximations for the simulation of oxygen K-edges are discussed in the Theory section. We subsequently discuss oxygen atoms and ions, binary molecules, water, and larger molecules containing oxygen, including biomolecular systems. The largest part of the review deals with the experimental results for solid oxides, starting from s- and p-electron oxides. Examples of theoretical simulations for these oxides are introduced in order to show how accurate a DFT description can be in the case of s and p electron overlap. We discuss the general analysis of the 3d transition metal oxides including discussions of the crystal field effect and the effects and trends in oxidation state and covalency. In addition to the general concepts, we give a systematic overview of the oxygen K-edges element by element, for the s-, p-, d-, and f-electron systems. }

	abstract = {Abstract A density functional calculation of the structural and electronic properties of polytetrafluoroethylene systems with several different dihedral angles is presented using two different local density approximations, the Gáspár–Kohn–Sham and the Perdew–Zunger. All the geometrical parameters were optimized simultaneously for the stable conformation. The torsional potential curve shows an absolute minimum at the dihedral angle of 163.7°, corresponding to a slightly deformed planar zigzag conformation. Other two distinct local minima for the quasi-stable helical conformation are found at the gauche form. The calculated valence and conduction bands are discussed and compared with other theoretical calculations and experiment. © 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc. Int J Quant Chem 64: 243–246, 1997},

    abstract = {Abstract How can the fundamental band gap of an insulator be predicted? As a difference of ground-state energies, the fundamental gap seems to fall within the reach of density functional theory, yet the predicted gaps from band structure calculations within the local density approximation (LDA) are about 40\% too small. It is argued here that even the exact Kohn-Sham potential veff(r), which generates the exact density in a self-consistent-field calculation, generates a band structure which underestimates the gap. Within the context of the band gap problem, several recent developments in the density-functional theory of many-electron systems are reviewed: (1) The Langreth-Mehl approximation to the Kohn-Sham exchange-correlation energy and potential, based upon the Langreth-Perdew wavevector analysis of the density gradient expansion. This functional leads to more accurate ground-state energies and densities than those of the LDA with little change in the calculated band structures of solids. (2) The derivative discontinuity of the exchange-correlation energy, which is responsible for substantial underestimation of the fundamental gap by even the exact Kohn-Sham potential. (3) The self-interaction correction, which yields accurate gaps in insulators only by virtue of its orbital-dependent potential. (4) The density response function of the uniform electron gas, which suggests that the LDA gives a good estimate of the exact Kohn-Sham potential for a semiconductor with a weak periodic potential. In short, several very different (but admittedly approximate) numerical calculations suggest that most of the error in the LDA fundamental gap would persist in the gap of the exact Kohn-Sham band structure. This error would persist in any attempt to calculate the gap from LDA total energy differences for clusters of increasing size.},

    abstract = { This communication deals with the general theory of obtaining numerical electronic wave functions for the stationary states of atoms and molecules. It is shown that by taking Gaussian functions, and functions derived from these by differentiation with respect to the parameters, complete systems of functions can be constructed appropriate to any molecular problem, and that all the necessary integrals can be explicitly evaluated. These can be used in connexion with the molecular orbital method, or localized bond method, or the general method of treating linear combinations of many Slater determinants by the variational procedure. This general method of obtaining a sequence of solutions converging to the accurate solution is examined. It is shown that the only obstacle to the evaluation of wave functions of any required degree of accuracy is the labour of computation. A modification of the general method applicable to atoms is discussed and considered to be extremely practicable. }

    abstract = { The classic density-functional theory (DFT) formalism introduced by Hohenberg, Kohn, and Sham in the mid-1960s is based on the idea that the complicated N-electron wave function can be replaced with the mathematically simpler 1-electron charge density in electronic structure calculations of the ground stationary state. As such, ordinary DFT cannot treat time-dependent (TD) problems nor describe excited electronic states. In 1984, Runge and Gross proved a theorem making TD-DFT formally exact. Information about electronic excited states may be obtained from this theory through the linear response (LR) theory formalism. Beginning in the mid-1990s, LR-TD-DFT became increasingly popular for calculating absorption and other spectra of medium- and large-sized molecules. Its ease of use and relatively good accuracy has now brought LR-TD-DFT to the forefront for this type of application. As the number and the diversity of applications of TD-DFT have grown, so too has our understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the approximate functionals commonly used for TD-DFT. The objective of this article is to continue where a previous review of TD-DFT in Volume 55 of the Annual Review of Physical Chemistry left off and highlight some of the problems and solutions from the point of view of applied physical chemistry. Because doubly-excited states have a particularly important role to play in bond dissociation and formation in both thermal and photochemistry, particular emphasis is placed on the problem of going beyond or around the TD-DFT adiabatic approximation, which limits TD-DFT calculations to nominally singly-excited states. }

A preliminary application of plasma diagnostics provides information on coronal temperatures and densities. Lines arising from different elements in a range of ionization states indicate that Capella has plasma with a broad range of temperatures, from log T = 6.3 to 7.2, generally consistent with recent results from observations with the Extreme-Ultraviolet Explorer and the Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics. The electron density is determined from He-like O VII lines, giving the value of Ne ~ 1010 cm-3 at Te ~ 2 × 106 K; He-like lines formed at higher temperatures give only upper limits to the electron density. The density and emission measure from O VII lines together indicate that the coronal loops are significantly smaller than the stellar radius.}

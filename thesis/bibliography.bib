In all cases, the functionals search for constrained minima. In particular, following Percus Q[p] = min ({IIT}+ Veeifp) is identified as the universal functional of Hohenberg and Kohn for the sum of the kinetic and electron-electron repulsion energies of an N-representable trial electron density p. {QIPJ} all antisymmetric wavefunctions I' which yield the fixed p. Q1p] then delivers that expectation value which is a minimum. Similarly, W[y] = min (¶7'{VeeI}') is shown to be the universal functional for the electron-electron repulsion energy of an N-representable trial first-order density matrix y, where the actual external potential may be nonlocal as well as local. These universal functions do not require that a trial function for a variational calculation be associated with a ground state of some external potential: Thus, the v-representability problem, which is especially severe for trial firstorder density matrices, has been solved. Universal variational functionals in Hartree-Fock and other restricted wavefunction theories are also presented. Finally, natural spin-orbital functional theory is compared with traditional orbital formulations in density functional theory.},

	abstract = {Vibrational spectra for a single molecule adsorbed on a solid surface have been obtained with a scanning tunneling microscope ({STM}). Inelastic electron tunneling spectra for an isolated acetylene (C2H2) molecule adsorbed on the copper (100) surface showed an increase in the tunneling conductance at 358 millivolts, resulting from excitation of the C-H stretch mode. An isotopic shift to 266 millivolts was observed for deuterated acetylene (C2D2). Vibrational microscopy from spatial imaging of the inelastic tunneling channels yielded additional data to further distinguish and characterize the two isotopes. Single-molecule vibrational analysis should lead to better understanding and control of surface chemistry at the atomic level.},

Discovering pathways to experimentally realize quantum phases of matter and exert control over their properties is a central goal of modern condensed-matter physics, which holds promise for a new generation of electronic/photonic devices with currently inaccessible and likely unimaginable functionalities. In this Review, we describe emerging strategies for selectively perturbing microscopic interaction parameters, which can be used to transform materials into a desired quantum state. Particular emphasis will be placed on recent successes to tailor electronic interaction parameters through the application of intense fields, impulsive electromagnetic stimulation, and nanostructuring or interface engineering. Together these approaches outline a potential roadmap to an era of quantum phenomena on demand.},

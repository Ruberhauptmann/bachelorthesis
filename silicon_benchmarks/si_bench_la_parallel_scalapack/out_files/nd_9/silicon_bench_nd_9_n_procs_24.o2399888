     Parallel version (MPI), running on    24 processors

     MPI processes distributed on     2 nodes
     R & G space division:  proc/nbgrp/npool/nimage =      24
     55855 MiB available memory on the printing compute node when the environment starts

     Reading input from in_files/silicon_bench_nd_9_n_procs_24.scf

     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  4

     Subspace diagonalization in iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem:
     one sub-group per band group will be used
     scalapack distributed-memory algorithm (size of sub-group:  3*  3 procs)

NOTE: invoking MPI_ABORT causes Open MPI to kill all MPI processes.
You may or may not see output from other processes, depending on
exactly when Open MPI kills them.

     Parallel version (MPI), running on    20 processors

     MPI processes distributed on     1 nodes
     K-points division:     npool     =       2
     R & G space division:  proc/nbgrp/npool/nimage =      10
     40344 MiB available memory on the printing compute node when the environment starts

     Reading input from in_files/silicon_bench_nk_2_n_procs_20.scf

     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  4

     Subspace diagonalization in iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem:
     one sub-group per band group will be used
     scalapack distributed-memory algorithm (size of sub-group:  3*  3 procs)

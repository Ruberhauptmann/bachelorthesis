     Parallel version (MPI), running on    36 processors

     MPI processes distributed on     2 nodes
     R & G space division:  proc/nbgrp/npool/nimage =      36
     3873 MiB available memory on the printing compute node when the environment starts
 
     Reading input from in_files/silicon_ph_bench_nd_9_n_procs_36_0.scf

     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  4

     Subspace diagonalization in iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem:
     one sub-group per band group will be used
     scalapack distributed-memory algorithm (size of sub-group:  3*  3 procs)
